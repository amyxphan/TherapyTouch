This project is a mobile app project that I am currently working on to create an all-in-one mental health app that allows users to recieve live help, journal, view their journey, and meditate. In this project, I hope to be able to learn more about mental health issues and create a product that's accessible for users to use and get help.

Currently working on: finding ways to log/document user activity, editing UI for productivy pages to match the figma and all look the same

Future Advancements: timer function, research to help those with disabilities use app, and create a user login/account management system
