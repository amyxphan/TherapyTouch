Therapy Touch Project 

a mobile app that I am currently working on to create an all-in-one mental health app that allows users to recieve live help, journal, view their journey, and meditate. 
In this project, I hope to be able to learn more about mental health issues and create a product that's accessible for users of all backgrounds to use and get help.

Currently Working on: UI to match Figma design, functional frontend app 

Future updates: Accessibility contents, backend dev, and admin logins
